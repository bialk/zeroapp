=> LoadImage template function put into general scope from matting.h

=> Caching mechanism for texture load in matting (otherwise texture loaded
   every draw call

=> Create data relinking dialog. Use conception of "Old Data Base
   Path" "New Data Base Path". Also "Old Data Base Path" may be
   autocomputed by calclulating the longest common substring they
   begins with (this can be done by pressing button against
   string). New Data Path can be added manualy.

=> Separate Build Directory from source code

=> Brush editor may be build as mouse tracker. It will memorize
   trajectory of mouse as a set of points. Each point will have
   position attribues + some additional expandable attributes which
   can be expanded. Also the REDO/UNDO operations must be implemented.

=> Optimization with Multigrid solver for SFS method
