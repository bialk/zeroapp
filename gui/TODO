=> point editor need to modify (it is difficult to work with point set,
it may be simplified somehow)
   
=> project need serialisation ideology when data may be easily
understood by user

=> setting pairs of points to the model is not always convenient. Good
idea is to use sliding points to fit the model. The point just show
the true position of the boundary in the MRI volume and an algorithm
should be able to fit model in accordance with the pointed boundaries.
 
=> add the old surface building algorithm

=> sparce matrix solver must be adopted.
