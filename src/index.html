<H3>Description</H3> 

Plastic surgery simulator is a medical application for the plastic
surgery planning. It is an environment which is developed to be able
to encapsulate the set of tools for 3D simulation technology. It is in
the development stage. In its current state the software contains jaw
and scull reconstruction modules and face registration module. As an
initial set of data for model reconstruction the MR (Magnetic
Resonance) is used.  

<H4>3D anatomy reconstruction modules</H4> 

The model-based algorithm used for bone reconstruction. Is based on
the predefined 3D deformable model of the reconstructed bone. The
reconstruction procedure deform the initial model to fit the MRI
signal. The result of Reconstruction may also be corrected manually if
necessary.

<H4>Face registration procedure</H4> 

Face registration procedure allows to fit 3D face model, obtained from
3D scanner, with MRI data.
